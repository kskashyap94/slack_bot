# slack_bot
A sample slack bot that tells if any website is up

First create a slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps/new

Follow the steps https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html to create your first slack bot

Replace BOT_ID and SLACK_BOT_TOKEN with the generated BOT_ID and SLACK_BOT_TOKEN by following the above steps

Once you are done with updating the above, run the testbot.py:
you should see "StarterBot connected and running!" message, if everything goes well.

Now, open the URL created for your slack app and enter the URL you are willing to test prefixed with do command:

Eg: @testbot do <URL> [testbot is slack bot name, "do" is keyword used , <URL> is complete URL including protocol (like https://facebook.com)]
